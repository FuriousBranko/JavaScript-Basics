ASCII art representations of some common programming constructs:

1. **If Statement**:
```
  +---------+
  |  Start  |
  +---------+
      |
      v
  +---------+
  |   If    |----> [True] ----> +---------+
  |Condition|                   |  Code   |
  +---------+                   +---------+
      |
      v
  +---------+
  |  End    |
  +---------+
```

2. **If-Else Statement**:
```
  +---------+
  |  Start  |
  +---------+
      |
      v
  +---------+
  |   If    |----> [True] ----> +---------+
  |Condition|                   |  Code1  |
  +---------+                   +---------+
      |                            |
      | [False]                    v
      +----------------------> +---------+
                              |  Code2  |
                              +---------+
                                  |
                                  v
                              +---------+
                              |  End    |
                              +---------+
```

3. **For Loop**:
```
  +---------+
  |  Start  |
  +---------+
      |
      v
  +---------+
  | Initialize|
  +---------+
      |
      v
  +---------+     [True]
  |Condition|----------------> +---------+
  +---------+                  |  Code   |
      |                       +---------+
      |                           |
      | [False]                   |
      +----------------------> +---------+
                              |  End    |
                              +---------+
```

## Basic Logic Tasks

1. Write a function to check if a number is even or odd.
2. Create a function to convert temperatures between Celsius and Fahrenheit.
3. Design a function that takes a string and returns its reverse.
4. Write a function to calculate the factorial of a number.
5. Create a function that checks if a word is a palindrome.
6. Design a program that prints the Fibonacci sequence up to n numbers.
7. Write a function that finds the largest number in an array.
8. Create a function that counts the number of vowels in a string.
9. Design a program that simulates a basic calculator (add, subtract, multiply, divide).
10. Write a function that checks if a number is prime.
11. Create a function that finds the smallest number in an array.
12. Design a program that prints all numbers from 1 to 100, but for multiples of 3, print "Fizz" and for multiples of 5, print "Buzz".
13. Write a function that merges two sorted arrays into one sorted array.
14. Create a function that checks if two strings are anagrams.
15. Design a program that simulates a basic bank account with deposit and withdrawal functions.
16. Write a function that counts the occurrences of a specific element in an array.
17. Create a function that removes duplicates from an array.
18. Design a program that prints a pyramid pattern using asterisks.
19. Write a function that checks if a string contains only letters (no numbers or special characters).
20. Create a function that splits a sentence into words and counts the number of words.
21. Design a program that calculates the area of different shapes (circle, rectangle, triangle).
22. Write a function that finds the second largest number in an array.
23. Create a function that checks if a string is a valid email address.
24. Design a program that simulates a basic to-do list with add, delete, and view functions.
25. Write a function that checks if all elements in an array are the same.

These tasks start from basic and gradually increase in complexity, helping to build logical thinking and problem-solving skills incrementally.
