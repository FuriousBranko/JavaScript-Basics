### Tasks for Lesson 4: Arrays, Objects, and Their Methods

1. **(Current Section)** Create an object named `portfolio` that has properties `stocks` (an array of stock names) and `balance`. Add methods to this object to `addStock(stockName)` and `removeStock(stockName)` which modify the `stocks` array.

2. **(Current Section)** Write an arrow function that takes in an array of numbers and returns an object with properties `max`, `min`, and `average` of the numbers in the array.

3. **(Current + Basics)** Create a function named `describeStock` that takes in an object with properties `symbol`, `name`, and `price`. The function should return a string in the format: "The stock with symbol SYMBOL and name NAME is currently priced at PRICE."

4. **(Everything Before)** Write a function named `evaluatePortfolio` that takes in an object representing a portfolio. This object should have properties `stocks` (an array of stock objects) and `balance`. Each stock object has properties `name`, `price`, and `quantity`. The function should calculate the total value of the portfolio (stocks + balance) and return a message indicating if the portfolio has gained value (assuming an initial value of $10,000).
